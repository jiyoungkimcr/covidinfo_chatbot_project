# Covidinfo_chatbot_project ðŸ¦ 

This is a project for creating a telegram chatbot offering the real-time COVID InformationðŸ¦  to the users.<br />
In this version, the information is only confined to 'South Korea COVID' related info.<br /> 
There are 3 things you can get by talking to this chatbot as below:<br />
1) Today's new COVID case in South Korea<br />
2) Recent News (headlines and direct links to article) with keyword 'south korea covid'<br />
3) Images related to COVID (with keyword: how to fight covid)<br />

Methodology:<br />
I created 3 types of crawler mainly using beautifulsoup:<br />
- Crawler for the number of today's new covid case (in South Korea)<br />
- Crawler for the recent news related to South Korea Covid<br />
- Crawler for related images with keyword 'how to fight covid'<br />

And then, I created handler that contains the response messages of chatbot based on user's input.<br />
*Just FYI, you need to put your own chatbot's api token key and chat_id in your code to recreate your own bots using this repository's code.*
